A simple program that allows you download any video from Youtube  

DISCLAIMER: You will be redirected to the [savefrom.net](https://pt.savefrom.net/8/) page. I developed this script for learning purpose only.  
##### How it works:  
In order to run the program you have to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official page [python.org](https://www.python.org/)  
* Open your windows terminal by pressing the WINDOWS key + r. Type "cmd" and then click in "Ok"
* In Linux CTRL + T to open your terminal  

With your terminal opened, run the python file:  
`python ytdownloader.py`  

Then the program asks you to enter with the a valid url:  
`>>> URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeLFFXKaFZQ`  

Now, press ENTER. A new tab or browser will be opened and you will be ready to download the video
